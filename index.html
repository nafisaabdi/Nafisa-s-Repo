<h2>Interests</h2>

<p> Currently, I'm passionate about career development. I hope to be joining the workforce soon which is why I'm attempting to prepare myself for the job search process. Otherwise, I'd consider myself to be an ametuer photographer and avid reader. My experience at the UofM has allowed me to pursue several interests and continue to grow as a person. I've recently enrolled in the Volunteer Scholars Program and am still surprised by the breath of opportunities offered here. For that reason I'm constantly gaining new interests.</p>
